stdout is line buffered by default, so when we print "Hello" without a new line (program 1),
the buffer has the "Hello" characters in it by the time printf("\n") is called by the second process,
so the second process adds the newline to the buffer, prints its contents ("Hello\n") and then flushes it.

In program 2, buffer is flushed immediately after "Hello\n" is printed because newline is present.
After that, the second process adds newline to the buffer, prints the second newline character,
then flushes the buffer.
